            <p>
                I am currently a coding student at the University of Washington, and I am really excited about the opportunity to learn and grow in this field. I have been working in the restaurant industry as a bartender and server for almost a decade, but I have always felt limited by the toxic environment and the lack of opportunities for advancement. I have always enjoyed math and problem-solving, and I have always been drawn to the idea of using those skills to build and create things. When I learned about the field of coding and the many different ways that it can be used to make a positive impact on the world, I knew that it was something I wanted to pursue. It hasn't been easy â€“ learning to code has been challenging at times, and there have been plenty of frustrating moments. But overall, I have found it to be an enjoyable and exciting experience. I am constantly amazed by the things that I am able to do with code, and I am so excited about the endless possibilities that are available to me in this field. I am confident that with hard work and determination, I will be able to achieve my goals and make a meaningful contribution to the world through my work as a coder. I am looking forward to the bright future that lies ahead of me in this field.
