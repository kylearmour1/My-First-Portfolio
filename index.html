                    I am currently a coding student at the University of Washington, and I am really excited about the
                    opportunity to learn and grow in this field. I have been working in the restaurant industry as a
                    bartender and server for almost a decade, but I have always felt limited by the toxic environment
                    and the lack of opportunities for advancement. I have always enjoyed math and problem-solving, and I
                    have always been drawn to the idea of using those skills to build and create things. When I learned
                    about the field of coding and the many different ways that it can be used to make a positive impact
                    on the world, I knew that it was something I wanted to pursue. It hasn't been easy learning to
                    code has been challenging at times, and there have been plenty of frustrating moments. But overall,
                    I have found it to be an enjoyable and exciting experience. I am constantly amazed by the things
                    that I am able to do with code, and I am so excited about the endless possibilities that are
                    available to me in this field. I am confident that with hard work and determination, I will be able
                    to achieve my goals and make a meaningful contribution to the world through my work as a coder. I am
                    looking forward to the bright future that lies ahead of me in this field.
