# My First Portfolio

## Description

"I am creating my first portfolio website from scratch, and using this opportunity to learn and master flex boxes. Flex boxes play a crucial role in how the elements on a page are organized and aligned. I am also learning about building ID tags, creating anchors using the href attribute, and implementing smooth scrolling from the navigation bar to different sections on the page. In addition, I am adding a contact me page with links so that potential clients or employers can easily reach out to me. This project is a great chance for me to explore my creativity as a developer and discover what kind of websites I enjoy creating. It helps me determine my strengths and preferences as a developer."
